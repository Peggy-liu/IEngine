#Student Details: Peiqi Liu, 101808315, COS30019_A02_T041
#Features: Three inference methods implemented--1)Truth table
						2)Forward Chaining
						3)Backward Chaining
						4)General knowledge base for Truth Table
#Bugs:Truth Table not working as expected: there is always a case when KB is true and query is false;
